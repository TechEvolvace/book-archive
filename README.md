# Book Archive

## User Story 
I have a ton of hard-copies books, and I wanted to have a place where I can search up a book from one of my hard-copies book and part of that book's contents somewhere in a website online. It's also a place where others can view these books and their contents anytime they want to whenever they visit this website for free. This is intended to be an archive of those books, where their works can be here for anyone to read and/or reference for free forever.
